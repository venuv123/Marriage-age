# Project - Marriage Age

As a 28 year old, it feels as though the majority of my friends that are the same age or older are married... I'm curious about the statistics on marriage, not only in the US, but across the world. In this project, we will explore age of marriage data from [Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org/data/).


## Project Overview

In this project, we'll explore specifically:

* The average marriage age across countries.


## Getting Started

You'll need to install:

* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

### Data Files

* `age_of_marriage.csv` - Downloaded [Gapminder](http://www.gapminder.org/data/)
